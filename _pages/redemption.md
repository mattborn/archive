Since 2009, my wife, Megan, and I have been covenant members of [Redemption Bible Church](http://redemptionbc.org) in Arlington Heights, IL. As part of our regular service to the church, we have been responsible for leading nearly every aspect of visual and technical design including branding, print, web, mobile, apparel, interior design, stage design, signage, and motion graphics. We consider it a great privelege to use our creative gifts to help further the mission of our local church.
