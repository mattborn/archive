          <h3>Zero to one</h3>
          <p>In summer 2017, the pastor who married us asked if we would move to Utah to start a Christian church. We said no. Then we understood how important this was, moved away from family, and went all-in to build something incredible from nothing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Analog and digital</h3>
          <p>We needed everything. A new logo and type system. Pitch decks. Several iterations of a website. Micro-sites and forms. Video bumpers. Marketing graphics. Announcement slides. Big signs. Small signs. A neon sign. Ridiculous 30-foot signs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Design systems for churches</h3>
          <p>The best thing about my work for Ridgeline is that tons of it is being used by other churches all over the country through my partnership with MyXP. Since day one, we have been committed to helping churches thrive. As many as we can.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>High risk, high reward</h3>
          <p>Hands down, this is the biggest leap of faith my wife and I have ever taken. On Sunday, September 30, 2018 we held our launch service with 145 folks in attendence including 25 new families. That’s amazing for anywhere, but especially Salt Lake.</p>

          <h3>Employee advocacy</h3>
          <p>Four years ago, I didn’t know what this was. Most people still don’t. Yet we were early to market and I led code, pixels, and people as we scaled this to a multi-million dollar enterprise SaaS product.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Let’s NOT build this</h3>
          <p>With such a small team attracting the largest companies in the world, we needed to say NO at the right times. Zapier instead of RSS.</p>
