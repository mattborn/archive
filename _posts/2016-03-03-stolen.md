I was recently interviewed by my coworker [Alicia](https://twitter.com/aliciabjohnston) for a [meet the team blog post](http://sproutsocial.com/insights/meet-matt-born?utm_source=mattborndotcom) all about yours truly. In my interview, I had mentioned a bit of advice I heard from [Jim Coudal](http://humblepied.com/jim-coudal) via my good friend [Mig](http://mig.io)’s project, [Humble Pied](http://humblepied.com). Jim’s advice was to _“rip something off”_. Be sure to [watch the video](http://humblepied.com/jim-coudal) for the full context. Afterwards, Alicia recommended a book called [Steal Like an Artist](http://amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253) by Austin Kleon, so I ordered it immediately.

As soon as I finished reading, I set out to test these theories by stealing [this blog design](http://mattborn.com/air). [Information Architects](https://ia.net) has been one of my favorite brands for a very long time and anything involving those guys is worth stealing. If you like writing in markdown, [buy their Writer app](https://ia.net/writer).

Also, be sure to [read the book](http://amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253) for the full context as there is an _art_ to stealing. It’s only [$7 on Amazon](http://amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253) and takes about an hour to read.

Anyways, there is plenty more to be stolen…
